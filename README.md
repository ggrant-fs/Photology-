## API and Data Sample

Specify the API you are using and include a link. Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your API so we know you can access it and get the info you need

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
### Planning <!-- omit in toc -->

- Have a **thoroughly** developed `README.md` file. (Refer below to _"Step 5: Pitch Your Project Idea"_ for more.)

### React <!-- omit in toc -->

- Be a working, interactive React app, built using `create react app`.
- Utilize React Router, installed via NPM. 
- Have at least 6 separate, rendered components.
- Implement an organized and understandable React file structure.
- Utilize functional and class React components appropriately.
- Use Axios to consume data from Airtable, and GET/render that data in your components.
- Use Axios to POST/create new data on Airtable.
- Use **only** React for DOM Manipulation.

### Styling <!-- omit in toc -->

- Be styled, use CSS, Styled Components, CSS-in-JS, or a component library to style your react project.
- Use flexbox (`display: flex`) or CSS Grid (N/A if using a component library that handles this).
- Implement responsive design on 2 screen sizes, using a media query (desktop and mobile and N/A if using a component library that handles this).
  
### Linting <!-- omit in toc -->

- Indent properly.
- Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names.
- Follow `camelCase` and `kebab-case` conventions.
- Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code.
- Remove all `console.log()`s and commented out code (functional notes and comments are acceptable).

### Deployment <!-- omit in toc -->

- Deployed via Netlify.


#### PostMVP  
- Add Geolocation 
- Page icons that connect to social media pages
- video background
## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|July 10-12| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|July 13| Project Approval | Incomplete
|July 13| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|July 14| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|July 15| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|July 16| MVP | Incomplete
|July 17| Presentations | Incomplete

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
HTML,CSS, JavaScript
### Weaknesses:
Rendering from API
### Opportunities:
Full Grasp of React JS
### Threats:
Time
