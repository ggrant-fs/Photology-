## API and Data Sample

Specify the API you are using and include a link. Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your API so we know you can access it and get the info you need

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
### Planning <!-- omit in toc -->

- Have a **thoroughly** developed `README.md` file. (Refer below to _"Step 5: Pitch Your Project Idea"_ for more.)

### React <!-- omit in toc -->

- Be a working, interactive React app, built using `create react app`.
- Utilize React Router, installed via NPM. 
- Have at least 6 separate, rendered components.
- Implement an organized and understandable React file structure.
- Utilize functional and class React components appropriately.
- Use Axios to consume data from Airtable, and GET/render that data in your components.
- Use Axios to POST/create new data on Airtable.
- Use **only** React for DOM Manipulation.

### Styling <!-- omit in toc -->

- Be styled, use CSS, Styled Components, CSS-in-JS, or a component library to style your react project.
- Use flexbox (`display: flex`) or CSS Grid (N/A if using a component library that handles this).
- Implement responsive design on 2 screen sizes, using a media query (desktop and mobile and N/A if using a component library that handles this).
  
### Linting <!-- omit in toc -->

- Indent properly.
- Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names.
- Follow `camelCase` and `kebab-case` conventions.
- Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code.
- Remove all `console.log()`s and commented out code (functional notes and comments are acceptable).

### Deployment <!-- omit in toc -->

- Deployed via Netlify.


### PostMVP  
- Add Geolocation 
- Page icons that connect to social media pages
- video background
